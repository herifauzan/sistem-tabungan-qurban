**Learning:** Mixing helper functions like `findRowIndexById` with direct `getRows` calls creates severe N+1 read bottlenecks. Since `findRowIndexById` internally calls `getRows` again, performing this per request significantly slows down transaction processing.
**Action:** Fetch rows once per request using `getRows` and compute required indices or totals in-memory using `findIndex` and array methods.
